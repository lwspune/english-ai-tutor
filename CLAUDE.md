# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Preferences

### UI
- All student-facing screens must be mobile-first. Use Tailwind responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`) and test layouts at 375px width. Touch targets must be at least 44px. Avoid horizontal scroll.

### Testing
- Follow test-first (TDD): write or update tests before writing implementation code. Do not write implementation until the test exists and fails for the right reason.

### Planning
- For any new feature or non-trivial edit, always analyze and present a plan first. Get confirmation before writing any code.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # start dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build      # production build → dist/
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run preview    # preview production build locally
```

Edge function (Deno, deploy always with `--no-verify-jwt`). On Windows CMD use two lines:
```cmd
set SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
npx supabase functions deploy analyze-reading --no-verify-jwt
```

## Architecture

English reading-aloud evaluation app for high school students (grades 9–12) with a teacher dashboard. Designed to be teacher-independent — AI provides per-session feedback so the teacher acts as facilitator.

**Stack:** React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4, Supabase (auth, PostgreSQL, storage, edge functions), OpenAI Whisper API + GPT-4o-mini.  
**Deployed:** Frontend on Vercel, edge function on Supabase (ap-south-1), repo: github.com/lwspune/english-ai-tutor.

### Data flow for a reading session
1. Student opens a passage → records audio via `useAudioRecorder` (MediaRecorder → WebM blob). Recording auto-stops at `max(60s, word_count / 70 * 1.5 * 60)` seconds.
2. Audio uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket `audio` under `{studentId}/{timestamp}.webm`
3. Frontend reads `app_settings.ai_feedback_enabled` and passes it along with `grade` to the edge function
4. Edge function `analyze-reading`:
   - Checks attempt count (max 3 per passage per student) — rejects before any API call if exceeded
   - Checks audio blob size (min 5 KB) — rejects silent/accidental recordings
   - Calls Whisper API (`verbose_json`, word-level timestamps)
   - Aligns spoken words to passage using DP sequence alignment (not positional matching)
   - Computes `score_accuracy`, `score_wpm`, `score_phrasing`, `count_omissions`, `count_substitutions`
   - If AI feedback on AND transcript coverage ≥ 20%: calls GPT-4o-mini → structured JSON feedback
   - Falls back to rule-based feedback if AI is off or GPT fails
   - Saves `sessions` row → deletes audio → returns `{ sessionId }`
5. Student redirected to `/student/report/:sessionId` — word-by-word colour-coded report with structured feedback

### Metrics
- **Accuracy** — % of passage words read correctly (via sequence alignment)
- **Pace (WPM)** — words per minute vs grade-level target (grade 9→140, 10→150, 11→160, 12→170)
- **Phrasing** — % of notable pauses (>0.4s) that fall at punctuation boundaries (from Whisper timestamps)
- **Omissions** — passage words skipped entirely
- **Substitutions** — wrong word said in place of a passage word

### AI Feedback structure (GPT-4o-mini, stored as JSON in `feedback` column)
```json
{ "wentWell": "...", "focusOn": "...", "practiseWords": ["word1"], "tip": "..." }
```
`SessionReport` detects JSON vs plain text and renders accordingly — old sessions with plain-text feedback still display correctly.

### Teacher dashboard
- **AI Feedback toggle** — global on/off button in the header, persisted in `app_settings` table
- **Student detail** — progress table (oldest → newest) with ↑/↓ trend arrows per session
- **Recurring difficult words** — words mispronounced/skipped in 2+ sessions, shown as chips

### Auth & routing
- `AuthContext` holds both the Supabase `user` and app `profile` (from `profiles` table). Always use `profile` for role/grade — never `user.user_metadata` in components.
- `ProtectedRoute` accepts optional `role` prop (`"teacher"` | `"student"`). Root `/` redirects based on `profile.role`.
- The `handle_new_user` DB trigger auto-creates a `profiles` row on signup using `raw_user_meta_data`. When creating users manually via the Supabase dashboard, insert profiles via SQL instead (the dashboard doesn't set metadata at creation time).

### Database schema (key points)
- `profiles` — `role` is `teacher` or `student`; `grade` 9–12 (null for teachers)
- `passages` — `word_count` computed client-side on insert in `PassageManager`
- `sessions` — `word_results` JSONB `[{ word, spoken, status }]`, status ∈ `correct | substitution | omission`; also stores `score_accuracy`, `score_wpm`, `score_phrasing`, `score_fluency` (same as phrasing, kept for compat), `count_omissions`, `count_substitutions`, `feedback` (JSON string or plain text)
- `app_settings` — single-row table (`id boolean PK default true`), holds `ai_feedback_enabled boolean`
- RLS on all tables. `is_teacher()` security definer function used in profiles policy to avoid infinite recursion.

### Known production quirks
- **Edge function must be deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`** — Supabase's new `sb_publishable_...` key format is not a JWT, so the runtime rejects requests otherwise.
- **On Windows, `KEY=value command` syntax doesn't work** — use `set KEY=value` then the command on a separate line.
- **Creating users manually:** Supabase Auth dashboard doesn't set `raw_user_meta_data` at creation time, so the trigger inserts with default role `student`. Always follow up with a manual SQL insert into `profiles` for the correct role/name.
- **Storage RLS:** `storage.objects` has a policy `students can upload audio` allowing authenticated users to upload to their own folder (`{uid}/...`). Service role in the edge function bypasses this for downloads.

### Environment variables
Frontend (`.env.local`):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (new format: `sb_publishable_...`)

Edge function secrets (Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — used for both Whisper and GPT-4o-mini
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (auto-injected by Supabase runtime)

### Adding new users (manual process)
```sql
-- After creating user in Auth dashboard (email + password only):
insert into profiles (id, full_name, role, grade)
select id, 'Full Name', 'student', 10   -- or 'teacher', null
from auth.users where email = 'user@example.com';
```
